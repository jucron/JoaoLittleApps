# JoaoLittleApps

## Welcome to Johnny Little Apps!
>I've created this small application after going through extensive training in Java Language.
>All these Little Apps are part of Udemy's course Java Programming Masterclass (by Tim Buchalka)
>but they were all modified to fit in this compact application. They represent my learning process
>of CORE Java. You're welcome to play around and check what I've created. 
>NOTE: A reminder that this app is simple and pure Java based, to be run in terminal.

**For testing you can use the executable file "JoaoLittleApps.exe".**
